# 1 Create a function called process_pigs
# 2 Create an empty list called words_list
# 2 In process_pigs open the file "littlepigs.txt" for reading*
# 3 Use a "for in" loop to read each line from the file* 
# 4 Get a list of words in for each line
# 5 Add each word to your words_list
# 6 When you've finished reading the file sort words_list
# 7 Print out the words_list

# 8 Bonus Task 1 - From words_list create unique_words_list that contains each word only once
# 9 Bonus Task 2 - Modify your code from #8 so that each entry in unique_words_list consists of a list of a word and the count of that word. eg. [['a',50],['bat',1],['brick',30]...] (numbers not correct in example)
